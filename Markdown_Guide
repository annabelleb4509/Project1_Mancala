## Code

If you want to reference a variable or a function, you do it like this: `console.log`

You might want to try the `debugger` keyword.

Three backticks used for blocks of code like functions.

```javascript
const hello = function () {
    console.log('Heyyy');
}
```

```css
body {
    background-color: blue;
}
```

```Python
def hotdogs():
    print "Hotdogs";
```
